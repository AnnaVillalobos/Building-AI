# Building-AI
Assignments done for the Online Course "Elements of AI: Building AI - Advanced"*

During the course first I learned the basis of Artificial Intelligence and some of the needed statistics for that. The following part of the course was more hands-on learning, with programming exercises. The course went through the following topics: Bayes Rule and Classifier, Linear Regression, k-means, overfitting, Logistic Regrssion, Neural Networks, and Deep Learning. 

All the exercises are taken from the course page.
